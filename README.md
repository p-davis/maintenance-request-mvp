# maintenance-request-mvp
Winforms tool implementing the Model-View-Presenter pattern. Import data from external Maintenance software and change/add required information to records. Prompts the user to update data in external software, in order to maintain parity between both program databases.

Early Winforms project that I was asked to create in 2017 and my first attempt at implementing MVP pattern with WinForms.

[MVP Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649571.aspx "Model-View-Presenter")

There are many aspects I would do differently now, such as some methods could be broken down further and test could be introduced, but I am using this experience in current projects and do ont intend to go back to this.
